Khabib Nurmagomedov threatens to quit UFC after brawl
Russian fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov has threatened to quit UFC in the wake of his victory over Conor McGregor in Las Vegas at the weekend.
Nurmagomedov's countryman Zubaira Tukhugov -- a rostered featherweight fighter -- has been pulled from a fight against Artem Lobov following the brawl that broke out after Saturday's fight. In the chaos that ensued Tukhugov exchanged blows with McGregor after climbing into the ring.
"You canceled Zubaira's fight and you want to dismiss him just because he hit Conor," Nurmagomedov said in a lengthy Instagram post addressed to UFC.
